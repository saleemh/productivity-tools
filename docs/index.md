# Productivity Tools

This site mirrors my current productivity tools list from Notion and will evolve over time.

For now, this is a single page. Content here should match:

- Notion: http://notion.saleem.net/productivity-tools

You can paste the exported Markdown from Notion directly here, or maintain it manually until automation is added.

## Structure (temporary)

- What I use it for
- Key features or settings I rely on
- Shortcuts or workflows
- Links to official pages/downloads

Replace this section with the actual Notion content.
